# Advent of Code 2016 :christmas_tree:

# About :snowman:
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016) is here!

It's hard to imagine that this time last year I couldn't code yet! So this would be my first year of doing Advent of Code :blush: And having been writing JavaScript exclusively at work, I think this is a great opportunity for me to write some code in another language - in this case Python - as well as to regain my TDD knowledge.

# Testing :white_check_mark:

The code was test-driven with `unittest`. To run the tests, type the following in terminal:

```
$ pip3 install green
$ green
```

# Tools :wrench:

* Python
* unittest
